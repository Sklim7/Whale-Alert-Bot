# Whale Alert Script Description

This Python script monitors a cryptocurrency wallet on the [hypurrscan.io](https://hypurrscan.io) website, specifically tracking new orders and position updates for a given wallet address. It uses web scraping to extract data, sends real-time alerts via Telegram, and compares position changes over time to provide detailed updates. Below is a comprehensive overview of its features

Different wallets can be targetd by altering the hypurrscan addrress.
Must use own telegram bot token and chat id.

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Wallet Monitoring**
- **Target Wallet**: Monitors a specific wallet address on `hypurrscan.io` (e.g., `https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x744cf47e88d9d0847544f0ac2fa7575cf5925f79`).
- **Order Monitoring**: Checks for new orders every 5 seconds (`CHECK_INTERVAL = 5`).
- **Position Monitoring**: Updates position data every 60 seconds (`POSITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL = 60`).
- **Headless Browser**: Uses Selenium with Chrome in headless mode to scrape the webpage without opening a visible browser window.

### 2. **Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup**
- **Selenium Integration**:
  - Navigates to the wallet URL and interacts with the webpage (e.g., clicking tabs to access "ORDERS" and "POSITIONS").
  - Waits for elements to load using `WebDriverWait` to ensure reliable scraping.
  - Refreshes the page before each check to get the latest data.
- **BeautifulSoup Parsing**:
  - Parses the HTML content of the webpage to extract order and position data from tables.
  - Handles dynamic content by waiting for the table to load after tab clicks.

### 3. **Order Tracking and Alerts**
- **Order Extraction**:
  - Fetches the latest order from the "ORDERS" tab (assumed to be the 4th button on the page).
  - Extracts details such as transaction hash, amount, token, price, and USD value.
  - Determines the position type ("LONG" or "SHORT") based on the amount (positive for LONG, negative for SHORT).
- **Duplicate Prevention**:
  - Uses a `deque` (`order_history`) with a maximum length of 5 (`ORDER_HISTORY_SIZE = 5`) to track recent order identifiers.
  - Prevents sending duplicate alerts for the same order by checking if the order‚Äôs identifier is already in `order_history`.
- **Telegram Alerts**:
  - Sends a Telegram message for each new order with details:
    - Icon: `üü¢` for LONG, `üî¥` for SHORT.
    - Token and position (e.g., `[ETH] LONG`).
    - Price, size, and USD value.
    - Wallet URL for reference.
  - Example message:
    ```
    üö® Whale Alert!
    üü¢ [ETH] LONG
    Price: $2500.123456
    Size: 1.50 ETH
    Value: $3750.19
    https://hypurrscan.io/address/0x744cf47e88d9d0847544f0ac2fa7575cf5925f79
    ```
- **No Order Notification**: If no new order is detected, sends a simple message: `üêã No new order.`

### 4. **Position Tracking and Comparison**
- **Position Extraction**:
  - Fetches all positions from the "POSITIONS" tab (assumed to be the 3rd button on the page).
  - Extracts details for each position, including token, position type, leverage, value, size, entry price, mark price, PnL, funding, and liquidation price.
  - Creates a unique ID for each position (`token_position_entry_price`) to track changes over time.
- **Change Detection**:
  - Compares current positions with the previous positions (`last_positions`) to detect changes in:
    - Value
    - Size
    - Entry Price
    - PnL
  - Indicates changes with arrows:
    - `‚¨Ü` for increases (e.g., `(‚¨Ü +1.53)`).
    - `‚¨á` for decreases (e.g., `(‚¨á -0.50)`).
  - If there‚Äôs no previous data (e.g., first run), no change is shown.
- **Closed Position Detection**:
  - Identifies positions that were in the previous data but are no longer in the current data, marking them as closed.
  - Reports closed positions with a `(Closed)` label.
- **Telegram Alerts**:
  - Sends a Telegram message listing all current positions with their details and changes.
  - Includes closed positions at the end of the message.
  - Example message:
    ```
    üìä Positions:
    üü¢ ETH LONG 25X
    Value: $36.53 (‚¨Ü +1.53), Size: 0.02 (‚¨á 0.00)
    Entry: $1,967.30 (‚¨á 0.00), PnL: $-0.06 (‚¨á -0.02)

    üü¢ LINK LONG 10X
    Value: $15.41, Size: 1.10
    Entry: $14.005, PnL: $-0.004

    üî¥ TIA SHORT
    (Closed)
    ```
- **No Positions Notification**: If there are no positions, sends: `üìä No open positions.`

### 5. **Telegram Integration**
- **Bot Configuration**:
  - Uses a Telegram bot token (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) and chat ID (`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) to send messages.
- **Message Formatting**:
  - Uses emojis for visual clarity (e.g., `üö®` for orders, `üìä` for positions, `üü¢` for LONG, `üî¥` for SHORT).
  - Formats numbers with appropriate precision (e.g., prices to 6 decimal places, other values to 2 decimal places with thousand separators).
- **Reliable Sending**:
  - Sends messages via the Telegram API with a 10-second timeout to handle network issues.


## Limitations
- **Webpage Dependency**: Relies on the structure of the `hypurrscan.io` webpage (e.g., XPath for tab buttons, table column indices). If the webpage changes, the script may break.
- **No Persistence Across Runs**: Does not persist the last order identifier across script runs, so it may send a duplicate alert for the last order after a restart.
- **Minimal Error Reporting**: Does not log errors or failed Telegram requests; it silently continues if a request fails.
